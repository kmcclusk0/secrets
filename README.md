# Shh, thar be secrets within ðŸ¤«

This repository is a collection of various projects, files, snippets, and code from our secret scanning adventures. None of it is supposed to make sense or compile. But it is real code found 'in the wild'.

It's purpose enables for easier benchmarking of open-source and commercial secret scanning solutions.

Valid secrets have been scrambled in a way to make them invalid but still match expected rules and formats. And of course there are a bunch of 'false positives' for extra fun.

Each directory in this repository is an SHA1 hash of the source repository URL for internal tracking purposes. The directory structures within are as-is.
